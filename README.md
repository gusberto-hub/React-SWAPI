# Star Wars Exercise for SIT Academy

As a teaching assistant for the Full-Stack bootcamp i was also responsible for the solutios of the given exercises.
Since React got updated recently i updated the package to the newest version and built this application as a possible approach for a solution.
Besides the functionality i tried to style it in a star-wars-ish style.

## Why class components?
At that time in the course, the students weren't introduced to **functional components** yet. This is why this application is still written with good old **class components**.

## The Task

During this exercise the students work with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) and try to display the fetched data as follows:

The main idea is that there will be 4 columns:

1. First column: After the page loads show the list of the movies. By clicking on one movie the related starships should then be shown in column 2.

2. Second column: Show the starships of the movie that was selected in the first column. After clicking on one starship show the pilots of that starship in column 3.

3. Third column: Show the pilots of the starship that was clicked before. Each pilot should have the possibility to be added to the favourties pilots list on the next column.

4. Fourth column: This will be the column with the list of all selected favourite pilots.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
